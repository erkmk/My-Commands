Our issue is a file was loaded with old records, it basically duplicated those records in the close.  
We had the file deleted, but there were ids from prior closes that also related to those records.  
The deletion got rid of the bad load file and all historical records with the same ids.  
We are trying to reconcile the data we currently have in the system vs what we had before we loaded the bad file, 
so we can get the system back to what is was before the deletion.
